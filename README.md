# Lost 1.5

**For Scream Secrets Game Jam**  
*22 AUG 2024*

## Overview

**Lost 1.5** is a text-based interactive horror game where you wake up in a mysterious forest with no memory of how you got there. Armed only with a flashlight, you must navigate through the dark woods, confront terrifying specters, and unravel the secrets that lie within. The game focuses on atmospheric storytelling, timed decision-making, and a moral system that affects the outcome of your journey.

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
- Launch the game by running the `main.py` script.
- From the main menu, press `1` to start the game or `2` to exit.

### Exploration
- As you progress, you'll be presented with choices that guide your journey. Simply follow the prompts and make decisions that feel right to you.
- The game uses atmospheric descriptions and slow-revealing text to immerse you in the eerie environment.

### Combat
- **Timed Battles:** When a specter appears, youâ€™ll need to react quickly.
  - You have **5-7 seconds** to press `Enter` and shine your light on the specter.
  - **Success:** The specter is banished, and your emotional state may improve.
  - **Failure:** The specter attacks, leading to a decrease in your moral state, and potentially ending the game.

### Emotional State
- **Emotional Levels:** Your character's state of mind will change based on your decisions and battle outcomes.
  - **States range from:** Determined, Confused, Sad, Hopeless, Frantic, to Hysterical.
  - **Impact:** Your emotional state influences the story and its outcomes. Reaching the `Hysterical` state may lead to a game-over scenario.

### Making Choices

- Choices include deciding which path to take, whether to confront or flee from dangers, and how to interact with the environment.
